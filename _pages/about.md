Hey I'm Qiang, welcome to my homepage!

I'm a PhD student in machine learning under supervision of [Prof. Emine Yilmaz](https://sites.google.com/site/researchyilmaz/). I'm now affiliated with the [Web Intelligence Group](http://wi.cs.ucl.ac.uk/), the [Centre for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/), [Univeristy College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/).

My research interests lie in the areas of machine learning, and spans the entire theory-to-application spectrum from foundamental advances (e.g., Bayesian learning and causality analysis) to practical progress (e.g., text mining, sequential data modeling). My research has been applied to text classification, information retrieval, recommender systems and misinformation detection.
